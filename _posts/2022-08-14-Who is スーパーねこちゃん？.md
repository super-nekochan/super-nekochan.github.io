Now, creative works qualify for copyright protection if they are original, with most definitions of originality requiring a human author. Most jurisdictions, including [Spain](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=1319) and [Germany](https://dejure.org/gesetze/UrhG/7.html), specifically state that only works created by a human can be protected by [copyright](https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/). In the United States, for example, [the Copyright Office has declared](https://copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf) that it will “register an original work of authorship, provided that the work was created by a human being.” 

So as we currently stand, a human author is required to grant a copyright, which makes sense, there is no point of having a neural network be the beneficiary of royalties of a creative work (no bank would open an account for them anyways, lol).

I think amendments have to be made to the law to ensure that the person who undertook all the arrangements necessary for the work to be created by the neural network gets the credit but also we need to modify copyright law to ensure the original authors of the body of work used as data input to produce the new piece get their corresponding share of credit. This will get messy if someone uses for example the #1 song of every month in a decade to create the decade song, then there would be as many as 120 different artists to credit.

There will still be some ambiguity as to who undertook the arrangements necessary, only the one who gathered the data and pressed the button to let the network learn, or does the person who created the neural network's model also get credit? Shall we go all the way and say that even the programmer of the neural network gets some credit as well?

There are some countries, in particular the UK where some progress has been made to amend copyright laws to cater for computer generated works of art, but I believe this is one of those fields where technology will surpass our law making capacity and we will live under a grey area for a while, and maybe this is just what we need, by having these works ending up free for use by anyone in the world, perhaps a new model for remunerating creative work can be established, one that does not require commercial success to be necessary for artists to make a living, and thus they can become free to explore their art.

<small>[The Next Rembrandt](https://www.jwt.com/en/work/thenextrembrandt) is a computer-generated 3-D–printed painting developed by a facial-recognition algorithm that scanned data from 346 known paintings by the Dutch painter in a process lasting 18 months. The portrait is based on 168,263 fragments from Rembrandt’s works.</small>
